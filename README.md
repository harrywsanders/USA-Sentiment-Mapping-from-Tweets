### Project Goal
The aim of this project is to scrape political Tweets – those referencing #joebiden2020 – apply a sentiment 'score,' 
gather a political sentiment using the mean score and the mean confidence of that UserID, and map county-level political entropy. It's currently in its early stages–
the visualization above was a preliminary analysis. 

### In the future, we aim to:
* Rank counties by political entropy, and predict election variance by this measure.
* Establish a measurement of political entropy over time– especially how it relates to the rise of Trump-era partisainship.
* Connect the project to the Twitter API to enable a live stream of data visualization.
* Expand subject queries to cover other issues, like hotbutton topics or certain candidates. 
* Host a website that allows for user interaction with this data.
